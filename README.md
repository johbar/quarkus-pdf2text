# pdf-extractor-service

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Status

This is a simple case study for comparing [Golang](https://github.com/johbar/text-extraction-service) and Java/Quarkus.


## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
mvn package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.
